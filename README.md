### Observations

Ramicane has the lowes mean and median tumor size suggesting it may be the most effective treatment on this sample of mice.

Ramicane and Capomulin appear to be the most effective treatments in terms of reducing tumor volume in mice.

Capomulin had a lesser extent of deviation among that group of mice as a whole possibly suggesting a more predictable anticipated outcome after treatment.

An analysis baseon gender could reveal if treatment varies by sex

The weight of the mose has a strong positive correlation to the volume of the tumor as seen in scatterplots.
